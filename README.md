Features

Income vs. Expenses Analysis: Monthly comparison of income and expenses.

Spending by Category: Visualizes spending habits across different categories.

Needs vs. Wants Analysis: Breaks down essential vs. discretionary spending.

Savings Forecast: Uses ARIMA modeling to predict future savings.

Outlier Detection: Highlights suspicious transactions using Isolation Forest.
